# Multiclass pixel classifier
Deep learning segmentation method with low annotation requirement. 

Similar to [Ilastik pixel classification](https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/pixelclassification/pixelclassification) procedure. 

## Training Set 
For cell segmentation, one typically defines 3 categories of pixels: inside cells, outside cells and cell outter edges (third category allows a better separation of neighboring cells). 
This can be done using bacmman software.
